This project predicts credit risk of loan applicants using the German Credit dataset. It classifies applicants as good or bad credit risks with a machine learning model, offers insights into key risk factors, and provides an interactive Streamlit UI for real time predictions.
Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **German Credit Dataset** to predict whether a loan applicant is a **good** or **bad** credit risk. It applies machine learning techniques to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

 Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants. This project aims to build a model that classifies credit risk and offers key insights into the most influential factors affecting credit scores.

 Features
